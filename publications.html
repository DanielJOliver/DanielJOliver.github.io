										<h3>Gravitational wave peeps from EMRIs and their implication for LISA signal confusion noise</h3>
										<p> <a href="Classical and Quantum Gravity"><img src="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad40f2"/></a></p>
										<p> <a href="arXiv:2305.05793"><img src="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05793"/></a></p>
										<p> Abstract: Scattering events around the center of massive galaxies will occasionally toss a stellar-mass compact object into an orbit around the massive black hole (MBH) at the center, beginning an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). The early stages of such a highly eccentric orbit are not likely to produce detectable gravitational waves (GWs), as the source will only be in a suitable frequency band briefly when it is close to periapsis during each long-period orbit. This repeated burst of emission, firmly in the millihertz band, is the GW peep. While a single peep is not likely to be detectable, if we consider an ensemble of such subthreshold sources, spread across the Universe, together they may produce an unresolvable background noise that could obscure sources otherwise detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Previous studies of the extreme mass ratio signal confusion background focused either on parabolic orbits near the MBH or events closer to merger. We seek to improve this characterization by implementing numerical kludge waveforms that can calculate highly eccentric orbits with relativistic effects. Our focus is on orbits at the point of capture that are farther away from the MBH. Here we present the waveforms and spectra of peeps generated from recent calculations of EMRIs/extreme mass ratio bursts capture parameters and discuss how these can be used to estimate the signal confusion noise generated by such events. We demonstrate the effects of changing the orbital parameters on the resulting spectra as well as showing direct comparisons to parabolic orbits and why the GW 'peep' needs to be studied further. The results of this study will be expanded upon in a further paper that aims to provide an update on the EMRI signal confusion noise problem.</p>

										<h3>Improved Modeling of EMRI Signal Confusion Noise for LISA</h3>
										<p>Will Present Poster for American Physical Society (APS) April Meeting 2020<br />
										April 18th-21st 2020</p>
									</header>
									<p>Scattering events around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) will occasionally toss a stellar-mass compact object (CO) into a highly eccentric orbit around the SMBH, this is known as an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). A single source of highly eccentric EMRIs is not likely to be detectable because gravitational waves are only emitted when the CO is very close to the SMBH. However, If we consider an ensemble of such sources, spread across the Universe, together they produce an unresolvable background noise that may obscure sources otherwise detectable by LISA, the proposed space-based gravitational wave detector. A previous study of this EMRI signal confusion background used a Newtonian order approximation and older models of SMBH and compact object populations. We seek to improve this characterization by implementing a frequency domain, Teukolsky based code (where necessary augmented by a semi-relativistic approach) that can calculate highly eccentric orbits. Further, our group has used Illustris										, a cosmological simulation software package, to improve on previous population models. Here we present some of the preliminary results of this study.</p>

										<h3>Modeling populations of highly eccentric EMRI's for a LISA Signal Confusion Noise</h3>
										<p>Will give oral presentation for 50th Mid-American Regional Astrophysics Conference MARAC 2020<br />
										April 3rd-4th 2020</p>
									</header>
									<p>Illustris is a cosmological simulation software package that can be used to improve upon known extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) populations. A single source of these EMRIs is not likely to be detectable as gravitational waves are only emitted when the compact object is very close to the SMBH. However, an ensemble of these sources will produce an unresolvable background noise that may obscure sources that would be otherwise detectable by LISA. Using Illustris and waveforms created using a Teukolsky based code we will be able to create a noise curve for LISA to determine what sources would be rendered undetectable due to this background signal confusion noise (as previously discussed in Barack and Cutler 2004). We discuss how to use gravitational wave spectra, correctly redshifted, to assemble this background noise spectrum, guided by data from Illustris.</p>

										<h3>Computation of highly eccentric EMRI's to characterize background confusion noise in LISA</h3>
										<p>Poster for American Physical Society (APS) April Meeting 2019<br />
										April 13th-16th 2019</p>
									</header>
									<p>Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) result when stellar mass compact objects orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH) undergo radiation damping. Such systems are prime sources for the proposed space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. However, highly eccentric EMRIs produce significant gravitational radiation only when the orbiting body is at closest approach to the SMBH. While a single source is not likely to be detectable, an ensemble of many such sources may cause background confusion noise that could mask sources that LISA would otherwise detect. We solve the Teukolsky equation using a frequency domain hypergeometric approach to probe the gravitational radiation produced by highly eccentric EMRIs in hopes of characterizing this signal confusion background. This code is programmed in a new programming language called Julia which is syntactically similar to Python but comes close to the speeds of C or Fortran for numerical computation. Additionally, we discuss possible methods of skipping 									evaluation of small modes to speed up computation times.</p>
